# shiny_project

In this project, I use dataset 'Starbucks Locations Worldwide' from Kaggle. 
(Link: https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations) 

I hope through this app, users can learn about the global distribution of Starbucks and key marketing countries and cities. You can also find how many stores are in your country and which countries have the most.
